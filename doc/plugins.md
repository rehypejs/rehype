## List of utilities

See [**hast**][hast-util] for a list of utilities for working with the syntax
tree.
See [`unist`][unist-util] for other utilities which work with **hast**
nodes, too.
Finally, see [**vfile**][vfile-util] for a list of utilities working with
virtual files.

## Use plugins

To use a plugin programmatically, invoke the [`use()`][unified-use]
function.

To use plugin with `rehype-cli`, pass a [`--use` flag][unified-args-use]
or specify it in a [configuration file][config-file-use].

## Create plugins

Have an idea for a plugin?
Post it on [ideas][] and make it happen!

To create a plugin, first read up on the [concept of plugins][unified-plugins].
Then, read the [guide on “Creating a plugin with unified”][guide].
Finally, take one of existing plugins, which looks similar to what you’re about
to make, and work from there.
If you get stuck, [ideas][], [issues][], and [discussions][] are good places to
get help.

You should pick a name prefixed by `'rehype-'`, such as `rehype-lint`.

**Do not use the `rehype-` prefix** if the thing you create doesn’t work with
`rehype().use()`: it isn’t a “plugin” and will confuse users.
If it works with hast, use `'hast-util-'`, if it works with any unist tree,
use `unist-util-`, and if it works with virtual files, use `vfile-`.
